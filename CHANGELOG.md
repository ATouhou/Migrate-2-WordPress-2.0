Updates / Changes
----------------

### Beta 0.2

Full work in progress! Removed most cookie-code and WordPress DB-code I could find. Also rewrote Step 7 into "Finalize" and got it to list pages, delete pages, calculate a Title for each page (also copied to Step 3), and open a modal window for HTML edit. The Save here doesn't work yet though. You can now also create brand new pages in this step!

Also re-designed the Project Manager and Project Select pages giving the project lists big buttons instead of small links.

More to come. Next big thing is also of course to get the new Step 8 - "Export" - to work.

### Beta 0.0.1

Start of Life. Major re-structuring and changes to the fundamentals of [Migrate 2 WordPress](https://github.com/Bellfalasch/Migrate-2-WP). Created this new repo for it to work on until we leave the Beta stage at "Beta 1.0" (will become the 2.0 version of this project). Stay tuned!
